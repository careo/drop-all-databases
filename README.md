# drop-all-databases

Super useful, production ready, tool(s) to drop all* those pesky mysql databases.

Note: *all databases besides the ones MySQL wouldn't let you delete. Or at least probably wouldn't. I dunno, I've never tried to drop any of those. I'm not a monster.

# Usage

## Ruby

```
ruby drop-all-databases.rb
```

## Rust
```
cd rust
cargo run
```
